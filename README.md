# wallpaper

This is a Debian Package with more than 350 wallpapers and a script to change the wallpaper according to a defined time. 
The default time is 60 seconds. It is not a debian binary, but it is already ready for packaging... If you have any other distro that doesn't support deb packages you should just clone the repository and move the folders from here to the root folder.
